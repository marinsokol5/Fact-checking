# Fact-checking
 
With the proliferation of fake news on the web detecting such content is becoming increasingly important. Your task in this project is to build a system that can determine if a claim is Supported, Refuted, or there is not enough information to tell. The decision should be based on the text of the claim and on related evidence which is also given in textual form.
